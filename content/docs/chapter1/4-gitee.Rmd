## Update R version

`tidymicrobiome` require R version > 4.1.

You can check your R version in your console:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
version
```

If your R version is < 4.1, please download and install the [latest version of R](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html), and then restart your R.

## Install `tidymicrobiome`

Copy and paste the below code in your console.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
if(!require(remotes)){
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_git(url = "https://gitee.com/tidymicrobiome/tidymicrobiome", dependencies = TRUE)
```

## Some issues

1. During the installation, it will ask if you want to update some packages for few times, just enter `Enter` or `Reurn` key to skip it.
