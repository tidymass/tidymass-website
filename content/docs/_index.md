# If you are new to R or the tidyverse

We recommend that you start by learning some basics about R and the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) first, then return here when you feel ready. Here are some resources to start learning:

* [Finding Your Way To R](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/), from the RStudio Education team.

* [Learn the tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/learn/), from the tidyverse team.

# Part 1. Installation

You can learn how to install `tidymass`, and update it. You can also find here how to download the docker version of `tidymass` and build your own docker image based on `tidymass`.

# Part 2. Demo data

You can find here how to download the demo data and create `mass_dataset` class by yourself.

# Part 3. Data processing and analysis using tidymass

Here, you can learn how to use `tidymass` for data processing and analysis, from data converting to biological function mining.
